class TraceableTransform(Transform):
    """
    Maintains a stack of applied transforms to data.

    Data can be one of two types:
        1. A `MetaTensor` (this is the preferred data type).
        2. A dictionary of data containing arrays/tensors and auxiliary metadata. In
            this case, a key must be supplied (this dictionary-based approach is deprecated).

    If `data` is of type `MetaTensor`, then the applied transform will be added to ``data.applied_operations``.

    If `data` is a dictionary, then one of two things can happen:
        1. If data[key] is a `MetaTensor`, the applied transform will be added to ``data[key].applied_operations``.
        2. Else, the applied transform will be appended to an adjacent list using
            `trace_key`. If, for example, the key is `image`, then the transform
            will be appended to `image_transforms` (this dictionary-based approach is deprecated).

    Hopefully it is clear that there are three total possibilities:
        1. data is `MetaTensor`
        2. data is dictionary, data[key] is `MetaTensor`
        3. data is dictionary, data[key] is not `MetaTensor` (this is a deprecated approach).

    The ``__call__`` method of this transform class must be implemented so
    that the transformation information is stored during the data transformation.

    The information in the stack of applied transforms must be compatible with the
    default collate, by only storing strings, numbers and arrays.

    `tracing` could be enabled by `self.set_tracing` or setting
    `MONAI_TRACE_TRANSFORM` when initializing the class.

class InvertibleTransform(TraceableTransform):
    """Classes for invertible transforms.

    This class exists so that an ``invert`` method can be implemented. This allows, for
    example, images to be cropped, rotated, padded, etc., during training and inference,
    and after be returned to their original size before saving to file for comparison in
    an external viewer.

    When the ``inverse`` method is called:

        - the inverse is called on each key individually, which allows for
          different parameters being passed to each label (e.g., different
          interpolation for image and label).

        - the inverse transforms are applied in a last-in-first-out order. As
          the inverse is applied, its entry is removed from the list detailing
          the applied transformations. That is to say that during the forward
          pass, the list of applied transforms grows, and then during the
          inverse it shrinks back down to an empty list.

    We currently check that the ``id()`` of the transform is the same in the forward and
    inverse directions. This is a useful check to ensure that the inverses are being
    processed in the correct order.

    Note to developers: When converting a transform to an invertible transform, you need to:

        #. Inherit from this class.
        #. In ``__call__``, add a call to ``push_transform``.
        #. Any extra information that might be needed for the inverse can be included with the
           dictionary ``extra_info``. This dictionary should have the same keys regardless of
           whether ``do_transform`` was `True` or `False` and can only contain objects that are
           accepted in pytorch data loader's collate function (e.g., `None` is not allowed).
        #. Implement an ``inverse`` method. Make sure that after performing the inverse,
           ``pop_transform`` is called.
